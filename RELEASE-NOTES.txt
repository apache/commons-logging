Apache Commons Logging
Version 1.2
RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Commons Logging team is pleased to announce
the release of Apache Commons Logging 1.2

Apache Commons Logging is a thin adapter allowing configurable
bridging to other, well-known logging systems.

This is a maintenance release containing bug fixes.
Java 1.2 or later is required.

Changes in this version include:

Fixed Bugs:
o LOGGING-37:   Improve performance of LogFactory#getFactory() by calling
                Thread#currentThread()#getContextClassLoader() directly instead
                of using reflection. As a consequence support for JDK 1.1 has
                been dropped. Thanks to Matthias Ernst, Archie Cobbs.
o LOGGING-156:  Fix SecurityAllowedTestCase when executed with OpenJDK 1.7 due
                to an additional required RuntimePermission. Thanks to Mikolaj Izdebski.
o LOGGING-157:  Fix javadoc to comply with javadoc tool from jdk 1.8. Thanks to Ville Skytt√§.
