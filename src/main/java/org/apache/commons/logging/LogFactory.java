    // Implementation note re AccessController usage
    //
    // It is important to keep code invoked via an AccessController to small
    // auditable blocks. Such code must carefully evaluate all user input
    // (parameters, system properties, configuration file contents, etc). As an
    // example, a Log implementation should not write to its log file
    // with an AccessController anywhere in the call stack, otherwise an
    // insecure application could configure the log implementation to write
    // to a protected file using the privileges granted to JCL rather than
    // to the calling application.
    //
    // Under no circumstance should a non-private method return data that is
    // retrieved via an AccessController. That would allow an insecure application
    // to invoke that method and obtain data that it is not permitted to have.
    //
    // Invoking user-supplied code with an AccessController set is not a major
    // issue (for example, invoking the constructor of the class specified by
    // HASHTABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROPERTY). That class will be in a different
    // trust domain, and therefore must have permissions to do whatever it
    // is trying to do regardless of the permissions granted to JCL. There is
    // a slight issue in that untrusted code may point that environment variable
    // to another trusted library, in which case the code runs if both that
    // library and JCL have the necessary permissions even when the untrusted
    // caller does not. That's a pretty hard route to exploit though.

     * this method cannot return the object as the desired type. Note that it doesn't matter if the LogFactory class in the child class loader is identical to
     * the LogFactory class in the parent class loader, they are not compatible.

     * they remove all occurrences of the LogFactory class from the child class loader in order to resolve the issue. Note that they do not have to move the
