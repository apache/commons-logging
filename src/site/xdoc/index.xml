<section name="The Logging Component">

<p>When writing a library it is very useful to log information. However there
are many logging implementations out there, and a library cannot impose the use
of a particular one on the overall application that the library is a part of.</p>

<p>The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
implementations.  A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with
any logging implementation at runtime. Commons Logging comes with support for a
number of popular logging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a
reasonably simple task.</p>

<p>Applications (rather than libraries) may also choose to use commons-logging.
While logging-implementation independence is not as important for applications
as it is for libraries, using commons-logging does allow the application to
change to a different logging implementation without recompiling code. 
</p><p>
Note that commons-logging does not attempt to initialize or terminate the underlying
logging implementation that is used at runtime; that is the responsibility of
the application. However many popular logging implementations do automatically
initialize themselves; in this case an application may be able to avoid
containing any code that is specific to the logging implementation used.</p>

<section name="Documentation">

<p>The <a href="RELEASE-NOTES.txt">
Release Notes</a> document the new features and bug fixes that have been
included in the latest release.</p>

<p>The <a href="https//commons.apache.org/logging/apidocs/index.html">
Javadoc API documents</a> for the latest release are available online.
In particular, you should read the package overview of the <code>org.apache.commons.logging</code>
package. In addition, there is a (short)
<a href="guide.html">User Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https//wiki.apache.org/commons/Logging">Wiki site</a> has
the latest updates, an FAQ, and much other useful information.</p>
<p>
Users needing to become experts or wanting to help develop JCL should
(in addition) consult the <a href='tech.html'>Tech Guide</a>.
This gives short introductions to topics such as advanced class loading.

    <subsection name='Release 1.3.x'>
      <p>
        See <a href="changes.html">change-report</a>.
      </p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Release 1.2 - July 2014'>
      <p>The main purpose of the 1.2 release is to drop support for Java 1.1.</p>

      <a href="changes.html">change-report</a>.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Release 1.1.3 - May 2013'>
      <p>The 1.1.3 release only updates the Bundle-SymbolicName in the manifest
      to "org.apache.commons.logging".</p>
      <p>For a full list of changes since the 1.1.1 release, please refer to the
      <a href="changes.html">change-report</a>.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Release 1.1.2 - March 2013'>
      <p>The 1.1.2 release is a packaging of bug fixes since release 1.1.1.</p>
      <p>For the full details, see the release notes for this version.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Release 1.1.1 - November 2007'>
      <p>
       This release is a minor update to the 1.1 release that fixes a number of bugs, and 
       resolves packaging issues for maven 1.x and maven 2.x users.
      </p>
      <p>For the full details, see the release notes for this version.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Release 1.1 - 10 May 2006'>
      <p>This release makes several changes that are intended to resolve issues that
      have been encountered when using commons-logging in servlet containers or j2ee
      containers where complex classpaths are present and multiple copies of
      commons-logging libraries are present at different levels.</p>
      <p>This release also adds support for the TRACE level added to Log4j in the
      1.2.12 release. In former commons-logging versions, the log.trace method
      caused Log4j to output the message at the DEBUG level (the lowest level
      supported by Log4j at that time).</p>
      <p>For the full details, see the release notes for this version.</p> 
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Release 1.0.5 (Alpha)'>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> the 1.0.5 release was abandoned at alpha status.
      </p>
      <p>
    The next JCL release will be designated 1.1 since we feel this more 
    accurately reflects the improvements made to the codebase.</p>
