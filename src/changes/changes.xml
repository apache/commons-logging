This file is also used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits. TBA how to use this with SVN.

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version=nn]
then tweak the formatting if necessary
and commit

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.
