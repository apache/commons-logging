<p>Simple wrapper API around multiple logging APIs.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This package provides an API for logging in server-based applications that
can be used around a variety of different logging implementations, including
prebuilt support for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a> from Apache's
    Jakarta project.  Each named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance is
    connected to a corresponding Log4J Category.</li>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/util/logging/index.html">
    JDK Logging API</a>, included in JDK 1.4 or later systems.  Each named
    <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance is connected to a corresponding
    <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code> instance.</li>
<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/">LogKit</a> from Apache's
    Jakarta project.  Each named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance is
    connected to a corresponding LogKit <code>Logger</code>.</li>
<li><a href="NoOpLog.html">NoOpLog</a> implementation that simply swallows
    all log output, for all named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> isntances.</li>
<li><a href="SimpleLog.html">SimpleLog</a> implementation that writes all
    log output, for all named <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instances, to
    System.out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuring the Logging Package APIs</h3>

<h4>Choosing A <code>Log</code> Implementation</h4>

<p>The Logging Package APIs are configured based on the values of system
properties, which are normally set on the command line that started your
application.  The following system properties are global to all
<a href="Log.html">Log</a> implementations:
<ul>
<li><code>org.apache.commons.logging.log</code> - Fully qualified class name
    of the <code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> implementation to be
    used.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not specify the class name of the Log implementation to use, the
following algorithm is applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Log4J is available, return an instance of
    <a href="Log4JCategoryLog.html">Log4JCategoryLog</a> that wraps a
    Log4J Category instance of the specified name.</li>
<li>If the JDK 1.4 logging APIs are available, return an instance
    of <a href="Jdk14Logger.html">Jdk14Logger</a> that wraps an instance of
    <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code> for the specified name.</li>
<li>Return an instance of <a href="NoOpLog.html">NoOpLog</a> that
    throws away all logged output.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Configuring the Underlying Logging System</h4>

<p>The basic principle is that the user is totally responsible for the 
configuration of the underlying logging system. 
Commons-logging should not change the existing configuration.</p>

<p>Each individual <a href="Log.html">Log</a> implementation may
support its own configuration properties.  These will be documented in the
class descriptions for the corresponding implementation class.</p>

<p>Finally, some <code>Log</code> implementations (such as the one for Log4J)
require an external configuration file for the entire logging environment.
This file should be prepared in a manner that is specific to the actual logging
technology being used.</p>

<h3>Using the Logging Package APIs</h3>

<p>Use of the Logging Package APIs, from the perspective of an application
component, consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acquire a reference to an instance of
    <a href="Log.html">org.apache.commons.logging.Log</a>, by calling the
    factory method
    <a href="LogSource.html#getInstance(java.lang.String)">
    LogSource.getInstance(String name)</a>.  Your application can contain
    references to multiple loggers that are used for different
    purposes.  A typical scenario for a server application is to have each
    major component of the server use its own Log instance.</li>
<li>Cause messages to be logged (if the corresponding detail level is enabled)
    by calling appropriate methods (<code>debug()</code>, <code>info()</code>,
    <code>warn()</code>, <code>error</code>, and <code>fatal()</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, you might use the following technique to initialize and
use a <a href="Log.html">Log</a> instance in an application component:</p>
<pre>
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogSource;

public class MyComponent {

  protected Log log = LogSource.getInstance("my.component");

  // Called once at startup time
  public void start() {
    ...
    log.info("MyComponent started");
    ...
  }

  // Called once at shutdown time
  public void stop() {
    ...
    log.info("MyComponent stopped");
    ...
  }

  // Called repeatedly to process a particular argument value
  // which you want logged if debugging is enabled
  public void process(String value) {
    ...
    // Do the string concatenation only if logging is enabled
    if (log.isDebugEnabled())
      log.debug("MyComponent processing " + value);
    ...
  }

}
</pre>

</body>
