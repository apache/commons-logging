    <section name="Introduction">
        <p>
The Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL) provides a <code>Log</code> interface that
is intended to be both light-weight and an independent abstraction of other logging toolkits.
It provides the middleware/tooling developer with a simple
logging abstraction, that allows the user (application developer) to plug in
a specific logging implementation.
    </p>
<p>JCL provides thin-wrapper <code>Log</code> implementations for
other logging tools, including
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">Log4J</a>,
<a href="http://avalon.apache.org/logkit/index.html">Avalon LogKit</a>
(the Avalon Framework's logging infrastructure),
JDK 1.4, and an implementation of JDK 1.4 logging APIs (JSR-47) for pre-1.4
systems.
The interface maps closely to Log4J and LogKit.
</p>
        <p>
Familiarity with high-level details of the relevant Logging implementations is presumed.
    </p>
</section>
    <section name="Quick Start">
        <p>
As far as possible, JCL tries to be as unobtrusive as possible.
In most cases, including the (full) <code>commons-logging.jar</code> in the classpath
should result in JCL configuring itself in a reasonable manner.
There's a good chance that it'll guess your preferred logging system and you won't
need to do any configuration at all! 
		</p><p>
Note, however, that if you have a particular preference then providing a simple
<code>commons-logging.properties</code> file which specifies the concrete logging library to be
used is recommended, since (in this case) JCL will log only to that system
and will report any configuration problems that prevent that system being used.
    </p>
        <subsection name='Configuration'>
            <p>
There are two base abstractions used by JCL: <code>Log</code>
(the basic logger) and <code>LogFactory</code> (which knows how to create <code>Log</code>
instances). Specifying a particular Log implementation is very useful (whether that is
one provided by commons-logging or a user-defined one). Specifying a 
<code>LogFactory</code> implementation other than the default is a subject for
advanced users only, so will not be addressed here.
        </p>
            <p>
The default <code>LogFactory</code> implementation uses the following discovery process
to determine what type of <code>Log</code> implementation it should use
(the process terminates when the first positive match - in order - is found):
        </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
Look for a configuration attribute of this factory named
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> (for backwards compatibility to
pre-1.0 versions of this API, an attribute
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.log</code> is also consulted).
<p>
Configuration attributes can be set explicitly by java code, but they are more
commonly set by placing a file named commons-logging.properties in the classpath.
When such a file exists, every entry in the properties file becomes an "attribute"
of the LogFactory. When there is more than one such file in the classpath, releases
of commons-logging prior to 1.1 simply use the first one found. From release 1.1,
each file may define a <code>priority</code> key, and the file with
the highest priority is used (no priority definition implies priority of zero).
When multiple files have the same priority, the first one found is used.
</p>
<p>
Defining this property in a commons-logging.properties file is the recommended
way of explicitly selecting a Log implementation.
</p>
            </li>
                <li>
Look for a system property named
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> (for backwards
compatibility to pre-1.0 versions of this API, a system property
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.log</code> is also consulted).
            </li>
                <li>
If the Log4J logging system is available in the application
class path, use the corresponding wrapper class
(<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/Log4JLogger.html">Log4JLogger</a>).
            </li>
                <li>
If the application is executing on a JDK 1.4 system, use
the corresponding wrapper class
(<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/Jdk14Logger.html">Jdk14Logger</a>).
            </li>
                <li>
Fall back to the default simple logging wrapper
(<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/apidocs/org/apache/commons/logging/impl/SimpleLog.html">SimpleLog</a>).
            </li>
        </ol>
            <p>
Consult the JCL javadocs for details of the various <code>Log</code>
implementations that ship with the component. (The discovery process is also covered in more
detail there.)
        </p>
    </subsection>
        <subsection name='Configuring The Underlying Logging System'>
            <p>
The JCL SPI
can be configured to use different logging toolkits (see <a href='#Configuration'>above</a>).
JCL provides only a bridge for writing log messages. It does not (and will not) support any
sort of configuration API for the underlying logging system. 
        </p>
            <p>
Configuration of the behavior of the JCL ultimately depends upon the
logging toolkit being used. Please consult the documentation for the chosen logging system.
        </p>
            <subsection name='Configuring Log4J'>
                <p>
Log4J is a very commonly used logging implementation (as well as being the JCL primary default), 
so a <i>few</i> details are presented herein to get the developer/integrator going.
Please see the <a href='http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html'>Log4J Home</a> for more details
on Log4J and it's configuration.
            </p>
                <p>
Configure Log4J using system properties and/or a properties file:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
<strong>log4j.configuration=<em>log4j.properties</em></strong>
Use this system property to specify the name of a Log4J configuration file.
If not specified, the default configuration file is <i>log4j.properties</i>.
                </li>
                    <li>
<strong>log4j.rootCategory=<i>priority</i> [, <i>appender</i>]*</strong>
                </li>
Set the default (root) logger priority.
                    <li>
<strong>log4j.logger.<i>logger.name</i>=<i>priority</i></strong>
Set the priority for the named logger
and all loggers hierarchically lower than, or below, the
named logger.
<i>logger.name</i> corresponds to the parameter of
<code>LogFactory.getLog(<i>logger.name</i>)</code>,
used to create the logger instance.  Priorities are:
<code>DEBUG</code>,
<code>INFO</code>,
<code>WARN</code>,
<code>ERROR</code>,
or <code>FATAL</code>.
<br/>
Log4J understands hierarchical names,
enabling control by package or high-level qualifiers:
<code>log4j.logger.org.apache.component=DEBUG</code>
will enable debug messages for all classes in both
<code>org.apache.component</code>
and
<code>org.apache.component.sub</code>.
Likewise, setting
<code>log4j.logger.org.apache.component=DEBUG</code>
will enable debug message for all 'component' classes,
but not for other Jakarta projects.
                </li>
                    <li>
<strong>log4j.appender.<i>appender</i>.Threshold=<i>priority</i></strong>
                </li>
Log4J <i>appenders</i> correspond to different output devices:
console, files, sockets, and others.
If appender's <i>threshold</i>
is less than or equal to the message priority then
the message is written by that appender.
This allows different levels of detail to be appear
at different log destinations.
For example: one can capture DEBUG (and higher) level information in a logfile,
while limiting console output to INFO (and higher).
            </ul>
        </subsection>
    </subsection>
</section>
    <section name='Developing With JCL'>
    <subsection name="Obtaining a Log Object">
        <p>
To use the JCL SPI from a Java class,
include the following import statements:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <code>
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
<br/>
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
<br/>
        </code>
    </ul>
        <p>
Note that some components using JCL may
either extend Log,
or provide a component-specific LogFactory implementation.
Review the component documentation for guidelines
on how commons-logging should be used in such components.
    </p>
        <p>
For each class definition, declare and initialize a
<code>log</code> attribute as follows:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <source>
public class CLASS
{
    private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(CLASS.class);
    ...
    ;
        </source>
    </ul>
    <p>
Note that for application code, declaring the log member as "static" is more
efficient as one Log object is created per class, and is recommended.
However this is not safe to do for a class which may be deployed via a "shared"
classloader in a servlet or j2ee container or similar environment. If the class
may end up invoked with different thread-context-classloader values set then the
member must <i>not</i> be declared static. The use of "static" should therefore
be avoided in code within any "library" type project.
    </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Logging a Message">
        <p>
Messages are logged to a <em>logger</em>, such as <code>log</code>
by invoking a method corresponding to <em>priority</em>.
The <code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> interface defines the
following methods for use
in writing log/trace messages to the log:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <source>
    log.fatal(Object message);
    log.fatal(Object message, Throwable t);
    log.error(Object message);
    log.error(Object message, Throwable t);
    log.warn(Object message);
    log.warn(Object message, Throwable t);
    log.info(Object message);
    log.info(Object message, Throwable t);
    log.debug(Object message);
    log.debug(Object message, Throwable t);
    log.trace(Object message);
    log.trace(Object message, Throwable t);
        </source>
    </ul>
        <p>
Semantics for these methods are such that it is expected
that the severity, from highest to lowest, of messages is ordered as above.
    </p>
        <p>
In addition to the logging methods, the following are provided for code guards:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <source>
    log.isFatalEnabled();
    log.isErrorEnabled();
    log.isWarnEnabled();
    log.isInfoEnabled();
    log.isDebugEnabled();
    log.isTraceEnabled();
        </source>
    </ul>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Serialization Issues">
    <p>Prior to release 1.0.4, none of the standard Log implementations were
    Serializable. If you are using such a release and have a Serializable class
    with a member that is of type Log then it is necessary to declare
    that member to be transient and to ensure that the value is restored on
    deserialization. The recommended approach is to define a custom
    readObject method on the class which reinitializes that member.</p>
    <p>In release 1.0.4, all standard Log implementations are Serializable. This
    means that class members of type Log do <i>not</i> need to be declared transient;
    on deserialization the Log object will "rebind" to the same category for the
    same logging library. Note that the same underlying logging library will be
    used on deserialization as was used in the original object, even if the
    application the object was deserialized into is using a different logging
    library. There is one exception; LogKitLogger (adapter for the Avalon LogKit
    library) is not Serializable for technical reasons.</p>
    <p>Custom Log implementations not distributed with commons-logging may
    or may not be Serializable. If you wish your code to be compatible with
    any arbitrary log adapter then you should follow the advice given above
    for pre-1.0.4 releases.</p>
    </subsection>
</section>
<section name="Jars Included in the Standard Distribution">
    <subsection name="commons-logging.jar">
      <p>
The <code>commons-logging.jar</code> file includes the JCL API, the default 
<code>LogFactory</code> implemenation and thin-wrapper <code>Log</code> 
implementations for
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">Log4J</a>,
<a href="http://avalon.apache.org/logkit/index.html">Avalon LogKit</a>,
the Avalon Framework's logging infrastructure,
JDK 1.4, as well as an implementation of JDK 1.4 logging APIs (JSR-47) for 
pre-1.4 systems.
   </p>
   <p>
In most cases, including <code>commons-logging.jar</code> and your preferred 
logging implementation in the classpath should be all that is required to 
use JCL.
   </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="commons-logging-api.jar">
<p>
The <code>commons-logging-api.jar</code> file includes the JCL API and the 
default <code>LogFactory</code> implementation as well as the built-in
<code>Log</code> implementations SimpleLog and NoOpLog. However it does not
include the wrapper <code>Log</code> implementations that require additional
libraries such as <code>Log4j</code>, <code>Avalon</code> and
<code>Lumberjack</code>. 
</p>
<p>
This jar is intended for use by projects that recompile the commons-logging
source using alternate java environments, and cannot compile against all of
the optional libraries that the Apache release of commons-logging supports.
Because of the reduced dependencies of this jarfile, such projects should be
able to create an equivalent of this library with fewer difficulties.
</p>
<p>
This jar is also useful for build environments that automatically track
dependencies, and thus have difficulty with the concept that the main
commons-logging.jar has "optional" dependencies on various logging
implementations that can safely go unsatisfied at runtime.
</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="commons-logging-adapters.jar">
<p>
The <code>commons-logging-adapters.jar</code> file includes only adapters
to third-party logging implementations, and none of the core commons-logging
framework. As such, it cannot be used alone; either commons-logging.jar or
commons-logging-api.jar must also be present in the classpath.
</p>
<p>
This library will not often be used; it is only intended for situations where
a container has deployed commons-logging-api.jar in a shared classpath but a
webapp wants to bind logging to one of the external logging implementations
that the api jar does not include. In this situation, deploying the
commons-logging.jar file within the webapp can cause problems as this leads to
duplicates of the core commons-logging classes (Log, LogFactory, etc) in
the classpath which in turn can cause unpleasant ClassCastException exceptions
to occur. Deploying only the adapters avoids this problem.
</p>
    </subsection>

        <section name='JCL Best Practices'>
            <p>
Best practices for JCL are presented in two categories:
General and Enterprise.
The general principles are fairly clear.Enterprise practices are a bit more involved
and it is not always as clear as to why they are important.
        </p>
            <p>
Enterprise best-practice principles apply to middleware components
and tooling that is expected to execute in an "Enterprise" level
environment.
These issues relate to Logging as Internationalization,
and fault detection.
Enterprise requires more effort and planning, but are strongly encouraged (if not required)
in production level systems.  Different corporate enterprises/environments have different
requirements, so being flexible always helps.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section name='Best Practices (General)'>
        <subsection name='Code Guards'>
            <p>
Code guards are typically used to guard code that
only needs to execute in support of logging,
that otherwise introduces undesirable runtime overhead
in the general case (logging disabled).
Examples are multiple parameters, or expressions (e.g. string + " more") for parameters.
Use the guard methods of the form <code>log.is&lt;<i>Priority</i>&gt;()</code> to verify
that logging should be performed, before incurring the overhead of the logging method call.
Yes, the logging methods will perform the same check, but only after resolving parameters.
            </p>
        </subsection>
           <subsection name='Message Priorities/Levels'>
                <p>
It is important to ensure that log message are
appropriate in content and severity.
The following guidelines are suggested:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
<b>fatal</b> - Severe errors that cause premature termination.
Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
See also <a HREF="#National%20Language%20Support%20And%20Internationalization">
Internationalization</a>.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>error</b> - Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions.
Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
See also <a HREF="#National%20Language%20Support%20And%20Internationalization">
Internationalization</a>.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>warn</b> - Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors,
other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not
necessarily "wrong".
Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
See also <a HREF="#National%20Language%20Support%20And%20Internationalization">
Internationalization</a>.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>info</b> - Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown).
Expect these to be immediately visible on a console,
so be conservative and keep to a minimum.
See also <a HREF="#National%20Language%20Support%20And%20Internationalization">
Internationalization</a>.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>debug</b> - detailed information on the flow through the system.
Expect these to be written to logs only.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>trace</b> - more detailed information.
Expect these to be written to logs only.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </subsection>
            <subsection name='Default Message Priority/Level'>
                <p>
By default the message priority should be no lower than <b>info</b>.
That is, by default <b>debug</b> message should not be seen in the logs.
            </p>
        </subsection>
    </section>
    <section name='Best Practices (Enterprise)'>
          <subsection name='Logging Exceptions'>
               <p>
The general rule in dealing with exceptions is to assume that
the user (developer using a tooling/middleware API) isn't going
to follow the rules.
Since any problems that result are going to be assigned to you,
it's in your best interest to be prepared with the proactive
tools necessary to demonstrate that your component works correctly,
or at worst that the problem can be analyzed from your logs.
For this discussion, we must make a distinction between different types of exceptions
based on what kind of boundaries they cross:
           </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>
<b>External Boundaries - Expected Exceptions</b>.
This classification includes exceptions such as <code>FileNotFoundException</code>
that cross API/SPI boundaries, and are exposed to the user of a component/toolkit.
These are listed in the 'throws' clause of a method signature.
<br/>
Appropriate handling of these exceptions depends upon the type
of code you are developing.
API's for utility functions and tools should log these at the <b>debug</b> level,
if they are caught at all by internal code.
<br/>
For higher level frameworks and middleware components,
these exceptions should be caught immediatly prior to crossing
the API/SPI interface back to user code-space,
logged with full stack trace at <b>info</b> level,
and rethrown.
The assures that the log contains a record of the root cause for
future analysis <i>in the event that the exception is not caught and resolved
as expected by the user's code</i>.
<br/>
            </li>
               <li>
<b>External Boundaries - Unexpected Exceptions</b>.
This classification includes exceptions such as <code>NullPointerException</code>
that cross API/SPI boundaries, and are exposed to the user of a component/toolkit.
These are runtime exceptions/error that are NOT
listed in the 'throws' clause of a method signature.
<br/>
Appropriate handling of these exceptions depends upon the type
of code you are developing.
APIs for utility functions and tools should log these at the <b>debug</b> level,
if they are caught at all.
<br/>
For higher level frameworks and middleware components,
these exceptions should be caught immediately prior to crossing
the API/SPI interface back to user code-space,
logged with full stack trace at <b>info</b> level,
and rethrown/wrapped as <code><i>Component</i>InternalError</code>.
This ensures that the log contains a record of the root cause for
future analysis <i>in the event that the exception is not caught and
logged/reported as expected by the user's code</i>.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>Internal Boundaries</b>.
Exceptions that occur internally and are resolved internally.
These should be logged when caught as <b>debug</b> or <b>info</b> messages,
at the programmer's discretion.
            </li>
                <li>
<b>Significant Internal Boundaries</b>.
This typically only applies to middleware components that span networks or runtime processes.
Exceptions that cross over significant internal component boundaries such as networks
should be logged when caught as <b>info</b> messages.
Do not assume that such a (process/network) boundary will deliver exceptions to the 'other side'.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </subsection>
        <subsection name='When Info Level Instead of Debug?'>
                <p>
You want to have exception/problem information available for
first-pass problem determination in a production level
enterprise application without turning on <b>debug</b>
as a default log level.  There is simply too much information
in <b>debug</b> to be appropriate for day-to-day operations.
            </p>
        </subsection>
            <subsection name='More Control of Enterprise Exception Logging'>
                <p>
If more control is desired for the level of detail of these
'enterprise' exceptions, then consider creating a special
logger just for these exceptions:
            </p>
                <ul>
<source>
   Log log = LogFactory.getLog("org.apache.<i>component</i>.enterprise");
</source>
            </ul>
                <p>
This allows the 'enterprise' level information to be turned on/off explicitly
by most logger implementations.
            </p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection name='National Language Support And Internationalization'>
            <p>
NLS internationalization involves looking up messages from
a message file by a message key, and using that message for logging.
There are various tools in Java, and provided by other components,
for working with NLS messages.
                </p>
            <p>
NLS enabled components are particularly appreciated
(that's an open-source-correct term for 'required by corporate end-users' :-)
for <strong>tooling</strong> and <strong>middleware</strong> components.
                </p>
            <p>
NLS internationalization SHOULD be strongly considered for used for
<b>fatal</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>warn</b>, and <b>info</b> messages.
It is generally considered optional for <b>debug</b> and <b>trace</b> messages.
                </p>
            <p>
Perhaps more direct support for internationalizing log messages
can be introduced in a future or alternate version of the <code>Log</code> interface.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Classloader and Memory Management">
            <p>
The <code>LogFactory</code> discovery process (see 
<a href='#Configuration'>Configuration</a> above) is a fairly expensive 
operation, so JCL certainly should not perform it each time user code 
invokes: 
</p>
<source>LogFactory.getLog()</source> 
<p>
Instead JCL caches the 
<code>LogFactory</code> implementation created as a result of the discovery 
process and uses the cached factory to return <code>Log</code> objects.  
Since in J2EE and similar multi-classloader environments, the result of the 
discovery process can vary depending on the thread context classloader 
(e.g. one webapp in a web container may be configured to use Log4j and 
another to use JDK 1.4 logging), JCL internally caches the 
<code>LogFactory</code> instances in a static hashtable, keyed by classloader.
            </p>
            <p>
While this approach is efficient, it can lead to memory leaks if container
implementors are not careful to call 
</p>
<source>LogFactory.release()</source> 
<p>
whenever a classloader that has utilized JCL is undeployed.  If 
<code>release()</code> is not called, a reference to the undeployed 
classloader (and thus to all the classes loaded by it) will be
held in <code>LogFactory</code>'s static hashtable.
            </p>
            <p>
Beginning with JCL 1.1, <code>LogFactory</code> caches factory implementations in a 
"WeakHashtable". This class is similar to <code>java.util.WeakHashMap</code> in
that it holds a <code>WeakReference</code> to each key (but a strong reference
to each value), thus allowing classloaders to be GC'd even if
<code>LogFactory.release()</code> is never invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
Because <code>WeakHashtable</code> depends on JDK 1.3+ features, it is dynamically
loaded depending on the JVM version; when commons-logging is run on java versions
prior to 1.3 the code defaults to a standard Hashtable instead.
            </p>
            <p>
If a custom LogFactory implementation is used, however, then a
<code>WeakHashtable</code> alone can be insufficent to allow garbage collection
of a classloader without a call to <code>release</code>.  If the abstract class
<code>LogFactory</code> is loaded by a parent classloader and a concrete
subclass implementation of <code>LogFactory</code> is loaded by a child
classloader, the WeakHashtable's key is a weak reference to the TCCL (child
classloader), but the value is a strong reference to the LogFactory instance,
which in turn contains a strong reference to its class and thus loading
classloader - the child classloader. This chain of strong references prevents
the child loader from being garbage collected.
           </p>
           <p>
If use of a custom <code>LogFactory</code> subclass is desired, ensuring that
the custom subclass is loaded by the same classloader as <code>LogFactory</code>
will prevent problems.  In normal deployments, the standard implementations 
of <code>LogFactory</code> found in package <code>org.apache.commons.logging.impl</code> 
will be loaded by the same classloader that loads <code>LogFactory</code> 
itself, so use of the standard <code>LogFactory</code> implementation
should not pose problems. Alternatively, use the provided ServletContextCleaner
to ensure this reference is explicitly released on webapp unload.

    <section name='Extending Commons Logging'>
        <p>
JCL is designed to encourage extensions to be created that add functionality. 
Typically, extensions to JCL fall into two categories:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>new <code>Log</code> implementations that provide new bridges to logging systems</li>
            <li>
new <code>LogFactory</code> implementations that provide alternative discovery strategies
            </li>
    </ul>
        <subsection name='Contract'>
            <p>
When creating new implementations for <code>Log</code> and <code>LogFactory</code>,
it is important to understand the implied contract between the factory 
and the log implementations:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Life cycle</b>
                        <blockquote>
The JCL LogFactory implementation must assume responsibility for
either connecting/disconnecting to a logging toolkit,
or instantiating/initializing/destroying a logging toolkit.
                        </blockquote>
                </li>
                    <li><b>Exception handling</b>
                        <blockquote>
The JCL Log interface doesn't specify any exceptions to be handled,
the implementation must catch any exceptions.
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
                    <li><b>Multiple threads</b>
                        <blockquote>
The JCL Log and LogFactory implementations must ensure
that any synchronization required by the logging toolkit
is met.
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name='Creating a Log Implementation'>
        <p>
The minimum requirement to integrate with another logger
is to provide an implementation of the
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> interface.
In addition, an implementation of the
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</code> interface
can be provided to meet
specific requirements for connecting to, or instantiating, a logger.
    </p>
            <p>
The default <code>LogFactory</code> provided by JCL
can be configured to instantiate a specific implementation of the
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code> interface
by setting the property of the same name (<code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log</code>).
This property can be specified as a system property,
or in the <code>commons-logging.properties</code> file,
which must exist in the CLASSPATH.
        </p>
     </subsection>
        <subsection name='Creating A LogFactory Implementation'>
            <p>
If desired, the default implementation of the
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory</code>
interface can be overridden,
allowing the JDK 1.3 Service Provider discovery process
to locate and create a LogFactory specific to the needs of the application.
Review the Javadoc for the <code>LogFactoryImpl.java</code>
for details.

<section name='A Quick Guide To Simple Log'>
	<p>
JCL is distributed with a very simple <code>Log</code> implementation named 
<code>org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog</code>. This is intended to be a minimal
implementation and those requiring a fully functional open source logging system are 
directed to <a href='http://logging.apache.org/log4j'>Log4J</a>.
	</p>
 	<p>
 	<code>SimpleLog</code> sends all (enabled) log messages,
 	for all defined loggers, to <code>System.err</code>.  The following system properties
  are supported to configure the behavior of this logger:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.defaultlog</strong> -
      Default logging detail level for all instances of SimpleLog.
      Must be one of:
      	<ul>
      		<li><code>trace</code></li>
      		<li><code>debug</code></li> 
      		<li><code>info</code></li> 
      		<li><code>warn</code></li> 
      		<li><code>error</code></li>
      		<li><code>fatal</code></li>
      	 </ul>
      If not specified, defaults to <code>info</code>. </li>
  <li><strong>org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.xxxxx</strong> -
      Logging detail level for a SimpleLog instance named "xxxxx".
      Must be one of:
          <ul>
      		<li><code>trace</code></li>
      		<li><code>debug</code></li> 
      		<li><code>info</code></li> 
      		<li><code>warn</code></li> 
      		<li><code>error</code></li>
      		<li><code>fatal</code></li>
      	 </ul>
      If not specified, the default logging detail level is used.</li>
  <li><strong>org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showlogname</strong> -
      Set to <code>true</code> if you want the <code>Log</code> instance name to be
      included in output messages. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showShortLogname</strong> -
      Set to <code>true</code> if you want the last component of the name to be
      included in output messages. Defaults to <code>true</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime</strong> -
      Set to <code>true</code> if you want the current date and time
      to be included in output messages. Default is <code>false</code>.</li>
 <li><strong>org.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.dateTimeFormat</strong> -
      The date and time format to be used in the output messages.
      The pattern describing the date and time format is the same that is
      used in <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code>. If the format is not
      specified or is invalid, the default format is used.
      The default format is <code>yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss:SSS zzz</code>.</li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>
In addition to looking for system properties with the names specified
above, this implementation also checks for a class loader resource named
<code>"simplelog.properties"</code>, and includes any matching definitions
from this resource (if it exists).
