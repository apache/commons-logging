      <p>
        The Jakarta Commons Logging test cases make extensive use of
        sophisticated classloader configurations in order to simulate the
        behaviour of various containers. It is difficult to run these tests
        under Maven (which is used to generate the website). Once JCL is
        upgraded to Maven 2 it is hoped that we will be able to display a report
        on the unit tests.
